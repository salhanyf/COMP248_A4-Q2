# COMP248_A4-Q2

For this question you will program Nancyâ€™s Card Golf Game.<br>
To win this game you need some luck with the cards and a bit of strategy.<br>
Just like the outdoor game of golf the goal is to keep the score as low as possible.<br>

Advice on how to tackle this question:<br>
<pre> - Plan your solution before starting to program.<br>
This means be sure you understand how the game works before your program.<br>
Write as detailed an algorithm as you can!!!<br>
 - Start by writing the 1st two classes (DeckAndDiscard & Player) and testing them to make
sure they work as you expect them to. You don`t want to be debugging your classes and your
driver class all at the same time.<br>
 - When implementing the driver (Golf) do it in chunks. Do not implement the entire game all
at once. It will be harder to debug and will be frustrating.
